Yet from that moment on, you must don your armor, throw yourself into an endless battlefield, and walk a thorn-strewn path from which there is no return.\n\nIf the legendary \"Law of Cycles\" truly exists, if that law of salvation and hope truly stands above all things... then perhaps the final fate of magical girls is not quite so despairing after all."
